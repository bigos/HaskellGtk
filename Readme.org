* Haskell Gtk tutorial projects

This is supposed to be a folder for projects for my translation of the [[http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Python Gtk+3 tutorial]].

Not all examples are complete.

Last example added is translation of
[[http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/label.html#example][Label]]
from the Python tutorial.
